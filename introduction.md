# What is Alpha Track?

**50 Telegram channels. 4 personalized reports. Zero noise.**

---

## The Problem

You follow dozens of crypto channels. Influencers, projects, alpha callers, DeFi protocols. Every notification could be the next 100x or just another shill. You can't read everything. You can't ignore everything. You're stuck choosing between FOMO and information overload.

**50% spam. 40% irrelevant. 10% actually matters.** And by the time you find that 10%? It's too late.

---

## The Solution

Alpha Track is your AI-powered crypto intelligence platform. We read your Telegram channels so you don't have to.

**Here's how it works:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your channels">
    Add the Telegram channels you follow but can't keep up with
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI categorizes everything">
    Our AI reads, filters spam, and sorts content by topic
  </Step>
  <Step title="Daily reports with only what matters">
    Get 4 personalized digests with just the categories you care about
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sources linked for deep dives">
    Every insight links to the original message - verify anything
  </Step>
</Steps>

No spam. No noise. Just signal.

We scrape thousands of messages daily, filter out the garbage, categorize the good stuff, and deliver personalized reports based on what you actually want to read. Choose your categories (Influencer Insights, DeFi Activities, Global Market View, etc.) and get exactly that.

**In English, Russian, or Ukrainian.**

## Beyond Summaries

We're not building another news aggregator. We're building crypto intelligence.

Alpha Track analyzes sentiment across languages and regions. We track what influencers really think, not just what they post. We spot alpha through anomalies - when a message gets 10x more reactions in the first 5 minutes, you know something's up.

<Note>
**The vision:** Your personal AI research assistant that understands crypto, speaks every language, and delivers insights - not just information.

Think Bloomberg Terminal, but AI-driven, decentralized, and built for everyone.
