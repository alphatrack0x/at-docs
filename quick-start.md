# Quick Start Guide

**From zero to your first digest in 5 minutes**

Alpha Track is currently in closed beta. Request access through our bot and we'll get you set up.

## Step 1: Tell Us About Yourself

When you first open the bot, we'll ask a couple quick questions about your crypto experience and what you're looking for (trading, research, airdrops, etc.). This helps us understand our users better - your answers don't affect how the product works.

---

## Step 2: Add Your Channels

This is where the magic happens. Add the Telegram channels you normally read but don't have time to keep up with.

Three ways to add channels:

**Forward a message** - Just forward any message from a channel you want to track. We'll grab the channel automatically.

**Paste the username** - Send us the channel's @ handle (like @somechannel) or the full t.me link.

**Upload a list** - Have a bunch of channels? Send a .txt file with channel names, one per line.

<Note>
During beta you can add up to 20 public channels. Private channels aren't supported yet.
</Note>

## Step 3: Pick Your Categories

After adding channels, you'll see category buttons. Choose what you actually want to read:

- **Influencer Insights** - Opinions, strategies, forecasts from traders
- **Activities** - Airdrops, testnets, quests, DeFi opportunities
- **Global Market View** - Macro news, regulations, institutional moves
- **Exchange Promos** - Listings, campaigns, trading competitions
- **Summaries** - Multi-topic digests
- **IDO** - Token launches and sales

Pick as many or as few as you want. You can always change this later in settings.

## Step 4: Set Your Digest Schedule

Choose when you want to receive reports. We have four time slots:

- 1:00 AM
- 7:00 AM
- 1:00 PM
- 7:00 PM

During beta you can pick anywhere from 1 to 4 reports per day. More reports = more frequent updates. Fewer reports = longer digests with more content each.

We recommend starting with all 4 - you can always turn some off later once you find your rhythm.

---

## You're Done

That's it. Your first digest will arrive at your next scheduled time. Each report contains only the categories you selected, with 90%+ spam already filtered out. Every insight links to the original message so you can dig deeper when needed.

---

## Changing Settings Later

Everything lives under the `/menu` button:

- Add or remove channels
- Change categories
- Adjust delivery times
- View your current setup

## Tips

<Tip>
**Start with channels you actually follow but can't keep up with.** The value comes from filtering content you'd read anyway, not random channels.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Don't pick all categories.** The point is to filter. If you select everything, you're back to information overload.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Give it a few days.** The first digest might feel light if your channels were quiet. After a few cycles you'll see the pattern.
</Tip>
