# Alpha Track Product Roadmap

**From Personal AI Analyst to Bloomberg Terminal for Crypto**

*Last Updated: January 2026*
*Status: Living document - Updated quarterly*

---

## 🎯 Vision Statement

We're building the intelligence layer crypto has been missing.

Starting with a personal AI analyst that reads your Telegram channels, expanding to comprehensive sentiment tracking across platforms, and evolving into the Bloomberg Terminal for crypto - AI-driven, decentralized, and accessible to everyone.

**What Makes Us Different:**
The entire platform is built and operated by AI agents. From scraping to categorization to delivery - AI runs the show. We're not just using AI as a feature; we ARE an AI-native platform. This allows us to scale intelligence that would be impossible with human teams.

**Guiding Principles:**
- Ship fast, iterate faster
- Community feedback drives priorities
- Quality over features
- Transparency always
- AI-native architecture from day one

---

## 📍 Where We Are: Beta (Q1 2026)

### Current Product: Personal Summarizer

**What's Live:**
- ✅ **Telegram Integration** - Connect public channels you follow
- ✅ **6-Category Classification** - Influencer Insights, Activities, Global Market View, Exchange Promos, Summaries, IDO
- ✅ **Spam Filtering** - AI removes noise automatically (99% accuracy)
- ✅ **Universal Language Coverage** - Read channels in ANY language, get summaries in English/Russian/Ukrainian
- ✅ **4 Daily Digests** - Morning, midday, evening, night
- ✅ **Source Linking** - Every insight links to original message
- ✅ **Category Selection** - Choose which topics matter to you

**The Game Changer:**
AI doesn't just translate - it understands context, filters noise, and delivers intelligence. Follow alpha callers in any language. Get insights, not word-for-word translations.

**Current Scale:**
- Processing: 10,000+ messages daily
- Languages: Universal input (any language), English/Russian/Ukrainian output
- Daily digests: 4x delivery
- Status: Active beta

**What We're Learning:**
- Which categories resonate most
- How users discover channels
- What spam patterns evolve
- Where we can improve

**Premium Tier:** Launching right after beta concludes. Details on pricing and features coming soon.

### Coming Immediately Post-Beta: Message Intelligence Foundation

**Facts / Opinions / Emotions Classification**

Before we can track sentiment, we need to understand what we're reading. Our AI classifies every message:

- **Facts** - Objective events (verifiable: "Project X launched mainnet")
- **Opinions** - Reasoned analysis (subjective but argued: "I think X will pump because...")
- **Emotions** - Pure sentiment (gut reactions: "X is going to moon 🚀")

**Why this matters:** You can't do sentiment analysis on facts. A mainnet launch is neutral - it's what people SAY about it that's bullish or bearish. This classification is the foundation for everything that comes next.

**Status:** In development now. Launching right after beta.

## 🚀 Phase 1: Enhanced Intelligence (Q2-Q3 2026)

### Focus: From categories to projects, from reading to tracking, cross-platform expansion

### Key Features

#### Twitter Integration (Q2 2026)
**Expand beyond Telegram - this is priority #1**

- Same AI categorization as Telegram
- Track influencers across both platforms
- Cross-platform synthesis (Telegram + Twitter in one digest)
- Thread summarization
- Crypto Twitter is where narratives form - we need to be there

**Why Now:** Crypto alpha happens on Twitter publicly, Telegram privately. Waiting is not an option. You need both platforms unified.

#### Project & Token Tracking (Q2-Q3 2026)
**The Feature:** Track specific projects, not just categories

- **Automatic extraction** - AI identifies tokens and project names in messages
- **Subject clustering** - All messages about same project grouped together
- **Dedicated project views** - See everything about a project in one place
- **Custom following** - Add any project to track, beyond our 6 categories

**Use Case:** You hold 10 tokens. Follow them all. Get unified updates on each, not scattered across categories.

**Add Sentiment Later:** Once tracking is stable, layer in bullish/bearish signals per project.

#### Community Features (Q3 2026)
**Leverage collective intelligence**

- **Shared channel lists** - Curated collections by topic/strategy
- **Collaborative filtering** - Community helps identify quality sources
- **Channel leaderboards** - See which channels provide most value
- **Import/export** - Share your setup with others

**Why:** Network effects. Users helping users find signal. This builds moat.

#### Smarter Filtering
**Better noise detection:**

- Channel quality signals (engagement patterns, community trust)
- Advanced spam recognition
- Continuous learning from new patterns

#### Discovery Engine
**Find better sources:**

- Personalized channel recommendations
- Similar channel suggestions
- Trending channels by category
- Quality indicators

#### More Control
**Customize your experience:**

- Choose digest delivery times
- Set summary length (concise/detailed)
- Mix categories that matter to you

## 🧠 Phase 2: Sentiment & Intelligence (Q4 2026 - Q2 2027)

### Focus: Understanding sentiment, not just content

### Major Initiatives

#### Farcaster & Lens Integration (Late Q4 2026 / Early Q1 2027)
**Decentralized social is growing - we should be there**

- Same AI categorization for Web3-native social
- Track crypto-native communities on Farcaster
- Lens protocol integration for DeFi-focused content
- Cross-platform synthesis: Telegram + Twitter + Farcaster in one view

**Why:** The future of crypto social may be decentralized. Early positioning matters.

#### Sentiment Analysis (Q1 2027)
**Understand how people feel, not just what they say**

Building on our Facts/Opinions/Emotions foundation, we add the sentiment layer:

**Bullish vs. Bearish Tracking:**
- Track sentiment per project
- See influencer consensus
- Spot sentiment shifts early
- Compare across languages/regions

**Output:** Sentiment trends, divergence alerts, consensus tracking

**Our Edge:** We're building proprietary methodology for analyzing crypto messages at a fundamental level. Not just keyword matching - actual understanding of context, sarcasm, alpha vs. noise. This is our moat.

#### Alpha Alerts (Q1-Q2 2027)
**Real-time intelligence - catch opportunities when they emerge**

This is our answer to "I need it NOW, not in a daily digest."

Detect unusual engagement patterns:
- Viral content in first minutes
- Reaction spikes vs. baseline
- Cross-channel spread
- Influencer pile-ons

Get notifications when something significant breaks. Configurable thresholds so you're not spammed.
